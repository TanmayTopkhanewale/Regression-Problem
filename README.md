Insights for Management
Once you have identified significant factors and built reliable models, you can derive actionable insights:

Identify Key Drivers of Tips: Based on your analysis, highlight which factors (e.g., service quality, wait time, customer demographics) significantly influence tips.

Customer Service Strategies: Recommend training for staff in areas that are shown to improve customer satisfaction and, consequently, tips. For example, if wait time is a significant factor, consider strategies to reduce it.

Targeted Promotions: If certain customer segments (e.g., larger parties) tend to tip more, consider promotions or marketing strategies targeting these groups.

Feedback Mechanisms: Implement systems to gather customer feedback on service quality, which can be correlated with tip amounts to identify areas for improvement.

Performance Tracking: Encourage regular tracking of tips and associated factors to measure the impact of implemented strategies over time.
